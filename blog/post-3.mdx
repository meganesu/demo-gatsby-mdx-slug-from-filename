## Introduction

Like many people my age, I grew up on Nintendo handheld gaming systems. As I've gotten older and that millennial nostalgia has kicked in, I've been able to revisit some of my childhood-favorite titles, thanks to emulators like VisualBoy Advance. Then, last July, I started wondering how those emulators worked, and I decided I wanted to try building one myself.

Well, it's been eight months, and... I still haven't built an emulator. But I *have* built something else: [an interactive table of all the Game Boy opcodes](https://meganesu.github.io/generate-gb-opcodes).
